* Redis Oxide

[[https://travis-ci.org/dpbriggs/redis-oxide][https://travis-ci.org/dpbriggs/redis-oxide.svg?branch=master]]

A multi-threaded implementation of redis written in rust 🦀.

This project is intended to be a drop-in replacement for redis.
It's under construction at the moment.

** Design


=redis-oxide= is a black-box multi-threaded re-implementation of redis, backed by [[https://tokio.rs/][tokio]].
It features data-structure key-space/lock granularity, written entirely in safe rust.
It's currently protocol compatible with redis, so you should be able to test it out with your favourite tools.

The multi-threaded nature has advantages and disadvantages.
On one hand, =KEYS *= isn't particularly crippling for the server as it'll just keep a thread busy.
On the other hand, there's some lock-juggling overhead, especially for writes, which messes with tokio.

** Building / Running

There's currently no official release for the project. You can compile and install it yourself with the following command:

: cargo install --git https://github.com/dpbriggs/redis-oxide

Note: This project requires the rust nightly. You can use [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup]] to install it.

Once it compiles you should be able to run it with =~ redis-oxide=.

If you wish to download and run it yourself, you can do the following

#+begin_example
~ git clone https://github.com/dpbriggs/redis-oxide
~ cd redis-oxide
~ cargo run
#+end_example

Then use your favorite redis client. Eg. =redis-cli=:

#+begin_example
~ redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> set foo bar
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get foo
"bar"
#+end_example

Or using the redis library for python:

#+begin_src python
import redis
from pprint import pprint

r = redis.Redis()
r.set('foobar', 'foobar')
pprint(r.get('foobar'))

for i in range(100):
    r.rpush('list', i)

list_res = r.lrange('list', 0, -1)

pprint(list_res[0:3])
pprint(sum(map(int, list_res)))

total = 0
for i in range(100):
    total += int(r.lpop('list'))
pprint(total)
#+end_src

Which will print:

#+begin_src python
b'foobar'
[b'0', b'1', b'2']
4950
4950
#+end_src

** Things left to do

*** Basic Datastructures

- [X] Keys
- [X] Sets
- [X] Lists
- [X] Hashes
- [ ] HyperLogLog
- [ ] Geo
- [-] Sorted Sets
  - [X] Basic Functionality
  - [ ] Still need some operations
- [ ] Strings

We should solidify the above before working on the more complex bits, but contributions are welcome :)

*** Redis Compatibility

- [X] Resp / server
- [ ] Database compatibility
  - [ ] Unsure if this is a good thing -- may be better to port existing dumps.
- [ ] Blocking / Concurrent Ops (ttl/save-on-x-ops)
- [ ] CLI / config compatibility
- [ ] Authentication

NOTE: *DO NOT USE THE REDIS SOURCE CODE IN ANY WAY!*

This project is under active development, so things are a little messy.

The general design of =redis-oxide= is:

- A Command (=set foo bar=) is read off the socket and passed to the translate function in =src/ops.rs=.
  - The parser generates a =RedisValue=, which is the lingua franca of =redis-oxide=.
- This gets converted to an =Ops::XYZ(XYZOps::Foobar(..))= enum object, which is consumed by the =op_interact= function. 
  - A macro is used to provide automate this.
- This operation is executed against the global =State= object (using the =op_interact= function)
  - This will return an =ReturnValue= type, which is a more convenient form of =RedisValue=.
  - This =ReturnValue= is converted and sent back to the client.

Therefore, if you want to do something like implement =hashes=, you will need to:

1. Add a new struct member in =State=.
   1. You first define the type: =type KeyHash = DashMap<Key, HashMap<Key, Value>>=
   2. Then add it to State: =pub hashes: KeyHash=
3. Define a new file for your data type, =src/hashes.rs=.
   1. Keep your type definitions in =src/types.rs=!
4. Create an enum to track your commands, =op_variants! { HashOps, HGet(Key, Key), HSet(Key, Key, Value) }=
5. Implement parsing for your enum in =src/ops.rs=.
   1. You should be able to follow the existing parsing infrastructure. Should just be extra entries in =translate_array= in =src/ops.rs=.
   2. You will need to add your return type to the =ok!= macro. Just copy/paste an existing line.
   3. You should return something like =ok!(HashOps::HSet(x, y, z))=.
   4. A stretch goal is to automate parsing.
6. Implement a =async *_interact= for your type; I would follow existing implementations (eg. =src/keys.rs=).
   1. I would keep the redis docs open, and play around with the commands in the web console (or wherever) to determine behavior.
   2. Add a new match entry in the =async op_interact= function in =src/ops.rs=.
7. Test it! (follow existing testing bits; eg. =src/keys.rs=).
8. Please add the commands to the list below.
   1. If you're using emacs, just fire up the server and evaluate the babel block below (see =README.org= source)
   2. Alternatively, copy the script into a terminal and copy/paste the output below. (see raw =README.org=)

** Implemented Commands

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output raw :format org :exports results
  import redis

  r = redis.StrictRedis(decode_responses=True)

  all_commands = r.execute_command('printcmds')

  for command in all_commands:
      command_name, ops = command[0], command[1:]
      print(f'*** {command_name}\n')
      for op in ops:
          print(f'- ={op}=')
      print('\n')
